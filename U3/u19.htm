<h1><b>Unit 19: Computing in the workplace</b></h1>

<h3>Learning Aims</h3>
<p>In Unit 19, the learning aims focused on understanding how computing affects the workplace.</p>

<p><b>Learning Aim A:</b> Understand and demonstrate the personal characteristics valued by employers in the workplace<br>
This learning aim focuses on personal characteristics valued by employers in the workplace. These include communication and literacy, self-management, teamworking, problem-solving, digital literacy, numeracy, business and customer awareness, technical knowledge, and leadership and organisation skills. Understanding why these characteristics are valued is essential for professional development and successful career advancement.

<br><br>

I explored each of these personal characteristics and demonstrated them through various activities and tasks throughout the unit. For example, I participated in team projects to showcase my teamworking skills, practiced effective communication through presentations and written reports, and demonstrated problem-solving abilities by analyzing case studies and proposing solutions. Additionally, I honed my IT skills through practical exercises and projects, ensuring I meet the requirements valued by employers in the workplace.<br><br>

<b>Learning Aim B:</b> Prepare an application for an IT/computing job role<br>
This learning aim focuses on preparing to apply for IT and computing job roles effectively. It covers understanding different job roles in the IT sector and creative computing industries, searching for relevant job opportunities, and applying for positions using appropriate documents and techniques. I learnt about the job market, job advertisement features, and how to tailor my applications to match employers' expectations.

<br><br>

I researched various job roles in the IT sector and creative computing industries, understanding their requirements and responsibilities. I practiced searching for job opportunities using different platforms and criteria, such as technical skills and personal characteristics. Additionally, I prepared application materials, including resumes, cover letters, and digital portfolios, ensuring they effectively showcase my qualifications and suitability for the desired positions.<br><br>



<b>Learning Aim C:</b> Understand how social media and communication technologies are used in the workplace<br>
This learning aim focuses on understanding the role of social media and communication technologies in the workplace. It covers different types of social media platforms, their impact on individuals, organizations, and society, and how they contribute to productivity, collaboration, and problem-solving in project delivery.

<br><br>

I studied various social media and communication technologies, including blogs, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, understanding their features and functionalities. I explored their impact on individuals, organizations, and society, considering factors such as security threats, legislation, ethics, and environmental implications. Additionally, I learned how these technologies can enhance project delivery by improving communication, collaboration, and problem-solving among team members.<br><br>



<b>Learning Aim D:</b> Demonstrate how social media and communication technologies can be used to improve the delivery of a project<br>
This learning aim focuses on demonstrating the practical application of social media and communication technologies to enhance project delivery. Students learn about different tools and techniques that improve productivity, communication, collaboration, and problem-solving in project environments.

<br><br>

I applied various social media and communication technologies in project scenarios to improve efficiency and effectiveness. For example, I used web conferencing and desktop sharing tools for virtual meetings, real-time messaging for instant communication, and collaborative platforms for sharing ideas and reporting progress. I also utilized problem-solving tools like online forums and crowdsourcing platforms to generate innovative solutions and address project challenges effectively. Through practical exercises and project-based learning, I demonstrated how these technologies can positively impact project delivery outcomes.</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p><b>Assignment 1: Characteristics of an employee</b>
In this assignment, I was tasked with creating job advertisements for two different positions: a network administrator for the local police force and an animator for a computer games studio. I had to identify and explain at least three personal characteristics needed for each position and justify why these characteristics are valued by the respective clients. Additionally, I was required to demonstrate at least six characteristics myself through video/audio recordings and prepare a presentation discussing their importance for employment in the IT industry.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 2: Applying for a job</b>
In this task, I navigated a job listing website to select a position of interest to me, crafting a targeted covering letter and CV for that role. Afterwards, I had to elevate my application's appeal by incorporating supplementary documents such as a completed application form, a technical and employability skills review, and a digital portfolio showcasing my expertise. Engaging with peers to gather feedback on your application, implementing suggested improvements to better align with employers' expectations was the final task for this assignment.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 3: How a workplace uses communication technology</b>
This assignment revolved around examining the use and impact of social media and communication technologies within Coleg Cambria. It involved identifying, describing, and evaluating the effects of these technologies on individuals, the college, and society. Additionally, the assignment required reflecting on a specific project undertaken during the college course, detailing the use of various social media and communication tools in its execution and assessing their effectiveness. Furthermore, it entailed exploring interconnected systems involving these technologies, followed by a review, refinement, and recommendation process to enhance their utilisation in project delivery, all while adhering to specific criteria outlined for each task.</p>
