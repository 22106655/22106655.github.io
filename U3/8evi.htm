<h3>Assignment 1: Characteristics and Uses of Mobile Apps</h3><br>

<p>Assignment 1 required a comparison of two mobile applications, focusing on their features, usability, and appeal to users. For this assignment, I chose WhatsApp and NOW TV as the two apps to analyse. I reviewed their purposes, user requirements, user friendliness, dependence on particular hardware/software, interface elements, integration with standard operating system software, platforms and cross-compatibility, as well as how these features and characteristics affect their intended use, usability, and appeal to the audience. Additionally, I discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each app based on their features and characteristics. The purpose of this assignment was to make me aware of various purposes of apps in order to better plan and develop my own.</p>

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
<p>In Assignment 2, I create a plan for a mobile app prototype for CambriaTek, aimed at teaching young children the alphabet. The plan covered everything from the app's purpose and user requirements to storyboards, pseudocode, and pre-defined code blocks. I also sourced and modified assets like images and sound files and created a test plan to ensure the app's functionality. Throughout the process, I considered constraints such as time limitations and my level of technical expertise to ensure the plan was actually possible for me to complete.</p>

<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
<p>For the Mobile App Development project, I created a prototype app for CambriaTek, the purpose was alphabet learning for children aged 3-7. The app boasted a simple interface, engaging visuals, and interactive features like drawing and sound buttons. After development, I thoroughly tested the app, including feedback to enhance image quality and user experience. After completing the app, I reviewed its functionality, identifying areas for improvement and outlining strategies for future development to maximise user satisfaction and educational effectiveness</p>
