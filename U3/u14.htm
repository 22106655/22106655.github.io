<h1><b>Unit 14: Installing and maintaining software</b></h1>

<h3>Learning Aims</h3>
<p>In Unit 14, the learning aims were centered around installing and maintaining hardware.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim A:</b> Understanding the benefits and implications of installing and maintaining hardware in technology systems<br>
This aim centered on comprehending the advantages and consequences of hardware maintenance, identifying internal and external hardware components, and recognizing reasons for system maintenance.

<br><br>

I explored the benefits of hardware maintenance by investigating scenarios where it prevented faults, upgraded system performance, and enhanced customer service. Additionally, I discussed implications such as training needs, compatibility issues, and risks like data loss, demonstrating an understanding of how these factors impact individuals and organizations.<br><br>

<b>Learning aim B:</b> Planning installation and maintenance of hardware in a technology system<br>
This aim involved creating comprehensive plans for hardware installation and maintenance, considering client requirements, hardware components, tools, software resources, constraints, and test plans.

<br><br>

I developed detailed plans for installing and maintaining hardware, outlining activities, identifying necessary components and tools, describing fault-finding techniques, and proposing test plans. By considering alternative ideas and justifying final decisions based on client requirements and constraints, I demonstrated proficiency in planning hardware tasks effectively.<br><br>

<b>Learning aim C:</b> Installing, maintaining, and testing hardware in a technology system<br>
This aim focused on executing hardware installation and maintenance tasks, including preparation, fault finding, repair, upgrades, external device installation, system testing, and safety considerations.

<br><br>

I successfully executed hardware installation and maintenance procedures, following manufacturer instructions, using appropriate tools and techniques, and adhering to safety protocols. By identifying and repairing hardware faults, upgrading internal components, installing external devices, and conducting thorough system tests, I demonstrated competency in installing, maintaining, and testing hardware effectively.<br><br>

<b>Learning aim D:</b> Reviewing the modified technology system<br>
This aim required reviewing the modified technology system against the original brief, evaluating its suitability, and proposing improvements based on feedback.

<br><br>

I reviewed the modified system, assessing its alignment with the original purpose and client requirements. By gathering feedback, evaluating system performance, and proposing refinements to address identified weaknesses and constraints, I demonstrated proficiency in reviewing and improving technology systems.</p>

<br><br><br>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p><b>Assignment 1: Investigation</b><br>
This assignment involved creating a report for Cambria Creatives, detailing the benefits of installing and maintaining hardware in two different technology systems. It also required suggesting upgrades for internal and external components/devices for each system, reviewing the implications of hardware maintenance for the organization, and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the hardware for one of the systems. Additionally, the completion of System Specification Logs for each system was necessary

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 2: Planning</b><br>
Assignment 2 tasked me with planning the upgrade and maintenance of the hardware in one technology system for Cambria Creatives. The client's requirements included resolving boot-up issues, addressing slow performance, ensuring the system clock accuracy, improving multitasking capability, speeding up data transfer for an external hard drive, and installing a graphics tablet within a budget of Â£250. I described the purpose and client requirements, produce a detailed plan including installation and maintenance activities, hardware and software descriptions, fault-finding tools, and a test plan. Additionally, I was required to consider alternative ideas, justify final decisions, and explain how the plan meets the client's needs while addressing constraints.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 3: Repair, upgrade and review</b><br>
Assignment 3 focused on repairing, upgrading, and reviewing the modified technology system for Cambria Creatives. In Task 1, I was required to fault-find and repair two hardware faults, back up data, install and configure internal and external hardware components, test the system, meet with the client for feedback, and recommend further improvements. Task 2 involved evaluating the modified system against the initial plan, justifying changes, explaining how it meets the brief, suggesting improvements, and considering constraints. This assignment aimed to demonstrate my ability to install and maintain hardware, test system functionality, gather feedback, refine the system, and evaluate its suitability for the intended purpose.</p>
