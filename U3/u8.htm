<h1><b>Unit 8: Mobile Apps Development</b></h1>

<h3>Learning Aims</h3>
<p>In Unit 8, the learning aims focused on understanding the principles of mobile app development, developing a mobile app prototype, and testing and evaluating the prototype.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim A:</b> Understanding the principles of mobile app development.<br>
Engaging with various online resources and practical exercises, I gained an understanding of mobile app development principles. This encompassed learning about various aspects such as app design, user interface considerations, and the basics of using MIT app inventor. These resources provided a solid foundation for understanding mobile app development.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim B:</b> Develop a mobile app prototype.<br>
Building on the knowledge gained from the learning resources, I used MIT app inventor to develope a mobile app prototype. This involved translating conceptual ideas into tangible designs,  coding to implement functionality, and integrating essential features. Using industry-standard tools and platforms, I navigated through the development process, honing my skills in design, coding, and app development.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim C:</b> Test and evaluate the mobile app prototype.<br>
Following the completion of the prototype, thorough testing and evaluation were of the upmost importance to ensure its functionality, usability, and performance. Through testing procedures, I identified and addressed any issues, aiming to enhance the overall user experience. User feedback played a crucial role in iterating on the prototype, allowing for continual improvement and refinement.</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p><b>Mobile App Planning</b><br>
For the mobile app planning assignment, I outlined the concept, target audience, features, and functionality of the proposed mobile application. This involved conducting research, defining who would use the app, and coming up with a clear vision for the app's purpose.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Mobile App Prototype</b><br>
The development of the mobile app prototype was a hands-on task where I put theory into practice. Using my understanding of mobile app development principles, I made a functioning prototype that demonstrated proficiency in design, coding, and app development. This assignment showcased my ability to translate ideas into tangible digital solutions.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Testing and Evaluation:</b><br>
In the testing and evaluation portion of the assignments, I compiled a document detailing the procedures, results, and insights obtained from testing the mobile app prototype. I used various testing methods, user feedback analysis, and reflections on areas for improvement. It served as a valuable resource for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the prototype and guiding future versions.</p>
