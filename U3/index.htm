<p>Hi there, I'm Chiara Elliotte. I'm studying Level 2 ICT at Coleg Cambria Deeside, and it's been quite the adventure! I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can change our lives. Even though the coursework can be tough, I face each challenge with determination and a positive attitude.</p>

<p>Outside of class, you'll often find me in my garden, surrounded by plants. Gardening is my way of relaxing and appreciating the simple joys in life. I also love watching movies, from old classics to modern favorites, I enjoy them all. These hobbies help me to disconnect from the world of technology so I can maintain a healthy balance between both worlds</p>
