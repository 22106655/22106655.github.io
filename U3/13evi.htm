<h3>Assignment 1: Uses and features of a website</h3><br>

<p>In this assignment, I analyzed two websites, GoCompare.co.uk and Mobiles.co.uk. I assessed their strengths, weaknesses, and key features like hyperlinks, action buttons, and aesthetics. Through detailed descriptions and screenshots, I highlighted how these features impact usability, accessibility, and overall user experience.</p>
