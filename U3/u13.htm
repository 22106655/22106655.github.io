<h1><b>Unit 13: Website Development</b></h1>

<h3>Learning Aims</h3>
<p>In Unit 13, the learning aims focused on understanding the principles of website building, understanding the uses and features, making a website and reviewing a website.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim A:</b> Understand the uses and features of a website<br>
In this learning aim, I explored the range of uses and important features of websites, analysing their roles in presenting information, facilitating communication, and enabling transactions.

<br><br>

Through studying various examples and concepts, I gained insight into features like hyperlinks, action buttons, and accessibility options, recognising their significance in enhancing user experience and achieving specific website objectives. By actively engaging with different types of websites, such as e-commerce platforms, social networking sites, and education sites, I developed an understanding of how websites are used across various domains and industries. This knowledge provided a solid foundation for subsequent stages of website design, development, and review.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim B:</b> Design a website<br>
This learning aim involved the process of planning a website, considering factors like user requirements, visual aesthetics, and technical constraints.

<br><br>

By following structured design methods and taking advantage of design tools like storyboards, site maps, and style sheets, I created a detailed design documentation for my website. Through refinement and feedback loops, I made sure that the proposed design aligned with the intended purpose and user expectations. Additionally, I justified design decisions and explored alternative solutions to address potential challenges and constraints, demonstrating critical thinking and problem-solving skills in the design process.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim C:</b> Develop and test a website<br>
In this learning aim, I applied technical skills and methods to develop a functional website prototype and rigorously test its performance and usability.

<br><br>

By using website authoring software and appropriate techniques, I translated design specifications into web pages, including elements like text, graphics, forms, and interactive components. Through testing and feedback, I identified and addressed any issues or deficiencies in functionality, accessibility, and user experience. By refining the website based on test results and feedback, I ensured that the final product met quality standards and user expectations.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Learning aim D:</b> Review the finished website<br>
This learning aim focused on evaluating the completed website against predefined criteria, assessing its fitness for purpose, functionality, and user satisfaction.

<br><br>

With the help of the evaluation criteria, I critically analysed the website's performance, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. By considering user feedback, design objectives, and project constraints, I provided constructive insights and recommendations for enhancing my website's effectiveness and user experience. Additionally, I reflected on the development process, recognising lessons learned and strategies for future improvement in website design and development projects.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p><b>Assignment 1: Investigating Websites</b>
For this assignment, I conducted a detailed analysis of two different websites, exploring their features, usability, and effectiveness in meeting user needs. Through this investigation, I gained insights into the diverse purposes and functionalities of websites in various contexts, sharpening my ability to critically evaluate online platforms.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 2: Designing a Website</b>
In this assignment, I meticulously planned the structure, visual design, and interactive features of a website based on a given brief or scenario. Leveraging website authoring tools and techniques, I translated my design concepts into a comprehensive website prototype, ensuring alignment with user requirements and design principles.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 3: Developing and Testing a Website</b>
For the development phase, I implemented the design concepts into a functional website prototype, incorporating text, graphics, multimedia elements, and interactive components. Rigorous testing and refinement were conducted to optimize the website's performance, functionality, and user experience, ensuring its fitness for purpose and alignment with project objectives.

<br><br>

<b>Assignment 4: Reviewing the Finished Website</b>
In the final assignment, I reviewed and evaluated the completed website against predefined criteria, assessing its fitness for purpose, functionality, and user satisfaction. Through critical analysis and reflection, I identified strengths and weaknesses in the website's design and implementation, offering constructive feedback and recommendations for improvement. This process enhanced my ability to assess and refine digital products based on user feedback and project objectives.</p>
